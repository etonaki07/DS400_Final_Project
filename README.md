# DS400_Final_Project

### Introduction: 
	Early-onset dementia is a neurodegenerative disorder with symptoms that include memory problems, difficulty with language, problem-solving issues, personality changes, and visual problems. Early diagnosis of the onset of dementia can help improve a patient's quality of life, even though there is no cure. With this in mind, our project aims to determine the most crucial early predictors of the onset of dementia, whether a single strongest predictor or interactions between predictors.
