#### Faith Hardie

Hi my name is Faith Hardie and I am a third year student at Chaminade University. My major is Data Science and Visualization, with 3 certificates in Computer Science, Health, and Criminal Justice.  After I graduate I plan to apply the skills I learned to a career in the DoD, or pursue a masters. I hope to incorporate the critical thinking skills and hard skills I learned in DS-400 to approach statistical analysis in an unbiased, methodical manner.

 I’m Elora Tonaki and I’m a fourth-year student at Chaminade University of Honolulu. My major is Data Science, and I’m minoring in Computer Science. I’m interested in working with health data. So after graduation, I plan to find a career where I can apply my skills in Python,  Machine Learning, and use the statistical analysis I’ve learned in DS-400 where it’s needed.
 
### Introduction: 
Early-onset dementia is a neurodegenerative disorder with symptoms that include memory problems, difficulty with language, problem-solving issues, personality changes, and visual problems. Early diagnosis of the onset of dementia can help improve a patient's quality of life, even though there is no cure. With this in mind, our project aims to determine the most crucial early predictors of the onset of dementia, whether a single strongest predictor or interactions between predictors.
